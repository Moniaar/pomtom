## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Flutter SDK**: Ensure you have Flutter installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- **Dart SDK**: Comes bundled with Flutter.
- **IDE**: Use an IDE such as [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Flutter and Dart plugins installed.
- **Device/Emulator**: A physical device or emulator to run the app.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
   ```
   git clone https://git@github.com:Moniaar/pomtom.git
   cd flutter_timer_app
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. **Run the App**:
   ```
   flutter run
   ```

### Usage
Once the app is running, you can start by setting a timer using the intuitive UI. Choose your desired duration and mode (countdown, stopwatch, etc.), and hit the start button. You can pause, resume, or reset the timer as needed. If enabled, notifications will alert you when the timer reaches zero.

### Architecture
This Flutter Timer App follows a clean architecture pattern, separating concerns into different layers:

- Presentation Layer: Consists of the UI components, widgets, and state management.
- Domain Layer: Contains business logic and entities.
- Data Layer: Handles data persistence and retrieval.
The app uses the Provider package for state management and Flutter Local Notifications for notifications.

### Configuration
To customize the app further, you can modify the following configuration files:

lib/config/constants.dart: Contains constant values used across the app.
lib/config/themes.dart: Manages the theming of the app.
pubspec.yaml: Lists all dependencies and assets.

### Testing
The app includes unit tests and widget tests to ensure the functionality of various components:

- Unit Tests: Tests individual units of code such as functions or methods.
- Widget Tests: Tests UI components and their interactions.
To run the tests, use the following command:
```
flutter test
```

#### What I learned during the debugging phase:
- The debug console is your best friend when the app can't build when you run it.
- flutter pub get whenever you add an assest or a new dependcay or a plugin.
- Pubspec.yaml is very sensitive for identaion, you have to use your space not tab because it doesn't support it.
- Building wouldn't work without you fixing the pubspec.
- It's okay to add assets outside an assest folder (inside myapp folder which is the main one) if you have 2 or less. But once your assets are a lot, you will have to make a seprate folder for that.
