# Pomtom 
A minimal pomodoro app that will be your study buddy! :)

- Note: This is my final graduation project with ALX_SE program.
## Getting Started with a preview of the App:

### Checklist:
- Make the clock work in sync with the circle layout
- put a bar on the bottom of the app with 2 icons to navigate with
- The Personal tutor assistance on the 2nd page will be free for now, so make it work by any way you like
- A window that will ask you if you want to join the AI feature at first or not, once answered yes it won't appear again
- Do all this with the light theme as well


#### What I learned during the debugging phase:
- The debug console is your best friend when the app can't build when you run it.
A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
