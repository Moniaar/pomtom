A minimal pomodoro app that will be your study buddy! :)

### Checklist:

- Enhance the timer UI --> Change "foucs timer" to Pomtom with unique font and add some plugins.
- Make the AI Actually work ‚úîÔ∏è
- Remove the Settings button ‚úîÔ∏è
- Add gradiant to the balls on main welcome page
- Enhance the Chatbot UI
- Move the moon icon from its position
- Add a welcome page to show up once when the user installs the app, it should be the logo and name of the App
- put a bar on the bottom of the app with 2 icons to navigate with ‚úîÔ∏è
- The study buddy assistance on the 2nd page will be free for now, so make it work by any way you like 
- A window that will ask you if you want to join the AI premium feature at first or not, once answered yes it won't appear again üîú

2. Full access to AI (For now it's free all time)

#### What I learned during the debugging phase:
- The debug console is your best friend when the app can't build when you run it.
